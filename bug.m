In Objective-C, a subtle error can occur when dealing with mutable and immutable objects, especially within blocks or asynchronous operations.  Consider this scenario:

```objectivec
NSMutableArray *myArray = [NSMutableArray arrayWithObjects:@"A", @"B", @"C", nil];

dispatch_async(dispatch_get_global_queue(DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_DEFAULT, 0), ^{ 
    [myArray addObject:@"D"]; // Modifying mutable array in background thread
});

NSLog (@"Array count: %lu", (unsigned long)myArray.count); // Count may be 3, not 4 
```

The `NSLog` statement might print 3 instead of 4 because the array modification happens asynchronously. The main thread might finish executing before the background thread completes adding "D".
