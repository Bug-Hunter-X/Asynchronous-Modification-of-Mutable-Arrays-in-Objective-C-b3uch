# Asynchronous Modification of Mutable Arrays in Objective-C

This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in Objective-C related to modifying mutable arrays within asynchronous operations (such as using GCD or other concurrency mechanisms).  The core issue lies in the timing difference between the background thread modification and the main thread's access to the data.  The example showcases a mutable array modified in a background thread, but the main thread may not see the changes immediately, leading to incorrect results.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring thread safety and proper synchronization techniques, such as using dispatch barriers or other synchronization primitives, or making the access to the array synchronized.
